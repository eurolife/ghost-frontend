Rather than just endlessly posting and hoping someone is listening, you can track real signups against your work and have them subscribe to be notified of future posts. The feature that makes all this possible is called \u003cem\u003ePortal\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePortal is an embedded interface for your audience to sign up to your site.

There are a couple of interesting angles to this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as registered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages depending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some posts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a great draw to encourage people to sign up!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGhost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no passwords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email subscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site. Like magic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePortal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out, clicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in, clicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their name, email, and subscription settings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe floating Portal button is completely optional.
